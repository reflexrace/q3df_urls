What is taken from dfengine:

\con_height [0/1.0] - default console height as a fractional value +alt +shift

\con_useshader & \con_rgb & \con_opacity = Moved to 1 cvar
\cl_conColor [RRR GGG BBB AAA] - custom console color, non-archived, use \seta command to set archive flag and store in config (q3e)
default [60 60 70 220]
\con_useshader = \cl_conColor ""
\cl_MapAutoDownload [0/1] - (Reworked and now can use https)
\download + \dlmap (reworked) - \dlmap is the same as \download but also will check for map existence

What is taken from iodfe:

snap hud
scr_hud_snap_draw 1 - snapping hud, shows zones of possible acceleration (for 8 ms frametime)
scr_hud_snap_auto - auto-shifting angle of the hud for different strafe styles
scr_hud_snap_def - offset with no keys pressed or with scr_hud_snap_auto 0
scr_hud_snap_speed - calculate zones for the stated speed instead
colors and position settings:
scr_hud_snap_rgba1
scr_hud_snap_rgba2
scr_hud_snap_y
scr_hud_snap_h

scr_hud_pitch - angle marks, setting it to "-15 70" for example will put two marks at -15 and 70 degrees of pitch
colors and position settings:
scr_hud_pitch_rgba
scr_hud_pitch_thickness
scr_hud_pitch_width
scr_hud_pitch_x

\con_timestamp [0/1] - adds a timestamp at each message in console
\con_timedisplay [0-3] - displays time at input line (1), at right bottom console corner (2) or at both places (3)
\con_date_usa [0/1] - date DMY or YMD (new)

\con_completemapnames [0/1] - toggles /map and /devmap autocompletion (ioq3)

\s_muteWhenUnfocused 0|1 - mute sound when window is unfocused
\s_muteWhenMinimized 0|1 - mute sound when window is minimized

ctrl+enter in console sends message with /team_say
ctrl+shift+enter sends it with /tell to df_mp_trackplayernum

\in_forceCharset 0|1|2 - try to translate non-ASCII chars in keyboard input (1) or force EN/US keyboard layout (2) (q3e)

\r_xpos & \r_ypos - Set the position of the window and automatically store them

in /modelist added more resolutions

\con_notifylines, \con_notifykeep, \con_notifyX, \con_notifyY - settings chat messages (fixed)
\con_notifyXY_enable - the switch of the possibility of using \ con_notifyX, \ con_notifyY (default is 0)
Now correctly displays the position on any resolutions with the same parameters

The physics is the same as in quake3.exe, there are no jumps along the ramps at the wall as on q3wc1

What's new:(q3e)
a lot of security, performance and bug fixes
much improved autocompletion (map, demo, exec and other commands)
persistent console history
raw mouse input support, enabled automatically instead of DirectInput(\in_mouse 1) on Windows XP and newer windows operating systems
unlagged mouse processing, can be reverted by setting \in_lagged 1
MOUSE4 and MOUSE5 works in \in_mouse -1 mode
\in_minimize - hotkey for minimize/restore main window (direct replacement for Q3Minimizer)
\in_nograb 0|1 - do not capture mouse in game, may be useful during online streaming
\screenshotBMP and \screenshotBMP clipboard commands
hardcoded PrintScreen key - for "\screenshotBMP clipboard"
hardcoded Shift+PrintScreen - for "\screenshotBMP"
\com_maxfpsUnfocused - will save cpu when inactive, set to your desktop refresh rate, for example
\com_maxfpsMinimized - will save cpu when minimized, do not set it less than 10-20 since it may cause network lags and possible 1/x delay (only once) when returning to game
\com_yieldCPU - will save cpu when game active, useful only if you using com_maxfps to limit framerate
\com_affinityMask - bind Quake3e process to bitmask-specified CPU core(s)
\com_skipIdLogo 0|1- skip playing idlogo movie at startup
\r_hdr - use high dynamic range pixel format for framebuffers, improves visual quality [ https://imgur.com/a/R1yTE | https://imgur.com/a/Kjnwb ]
\r_fbo 0|1 - use framebuffer objects, enables gamma correction in windowed mode and allows arbitrary size (i.e. greater than logical desktop resolution) screenshot/video capture, required for high-quality bloom (2,3)
\r_bloom 0|1|2|3 - light bloom postprocessing effect:
   1 - 'OpenArena' legacy bloom
   2 - new high-quality bloom, uses FBO and ARB fragment shaders, requires \r_fbo 1
   3 - same as 2 but applies to HUD elements too
\r_dlightMode 0|1|2 - new per-pixel dynamic lights
   0 - VQ3 'fake' dynamic lights
   1 - new high-quality per-pixel dynamic lights, slightly faster than VQ3's on modern hardware
   2 - same as 1 but applies to all MD3 models too
\r_modeFullscreen - dedicated mode string for fullscreen mode, set to -2 to use desktop resolution, set empty to use \r_mode in all cases
\r_neatsky 0|1 - nopicmip for skyboxes
\r_ext_multisample 0|2|4|6|8 - multi-sample anti-aliasing
\cl_conColor [RRR GGG BBB AAA] - custom console color, non-archived, use \seta command to set archive flag and store in config
\in_forceCharset 0|1|2 - try to translate non-ASCII chars in keyboard input (1) or force EN/US keyboard layout (2)
\sv_levelTimeReset 0|1 - reset or do not reset leveltime after new map loads, when enabled - fixes gfx for clients affected by "frameloss" bug, however it may be necessary disable in case of troubles with GTV
negative \r_overBrightBits - force hardware gamma in windowed mode
\r_nomip 0|1- apply picmip only on worldspawn textures
\r_mapGreyScale 0|1 - recolor map to gray colors ( test it in q3dm6 )
application now uses correct gamma if it looses/recieves focus, also sets correct video mode during minimizing/restoring (not actual with \r_rbo 1)
application now sets desktop refresh rate in game in case if desktop and game resolutions is equal
less spam in console (try to set "\developer 1" to see what important things you missing)
faster shader loading, tolerant to non-fatal errors
reduced memory usage for dedicated servers
fast client downloads (http/ftp redirection)
fast client-initiated downloads (\download and dlmap commands)
you can use \record during \demo playback
conditional shader stages
linear dynamic lights

\in_minimize

cvar that specifies hotkey for fast minimize/restore main windows, set values in form
  \in_minimize "ctrl+z"
  \in_minimize "lshift+ralt+\"
  or so then do \in_restart to apply changes.
